What is ChatGPT?

ChatGPT is a large language model created by the company OpenAI. A large language model aims to understand and respond to text by training on a massive amount of data, typically millions or even billions of words. This training is part of a process called machine learning.

Machine learning enables computers to learn and improve their performance on a task over time. Machine learning is an umbrella term for a set of algorithms that analyze and find patterns from known historical information (“training data”) to make predictions on unknown/new information. Machine learning involves:

Feeding data into an algorithm.
Allowing the algorithm to “learn” from that data.
Using that learning to make predictions or decisions about new data.
ChatGPT was built using a more complex form of machine learning called deep learning. Deep learning attempts to replicate the way the human brain works, learning and improving over time. The more data the model is trained on, the better it can learn these patterns and make accurate predictions.

The amount of data ChatGPT was trained on is massive, consisting of hundreds of billions of words. The dataset includes sources from:

Websites
Books
Articles
Social media posts
News articles
And more!

Through processing all of this data, ChatGPT has “learned” the way information tends to be presented, using this to string together text. It predicts how a human would respond to a question, a word, or group of words, at a time.
