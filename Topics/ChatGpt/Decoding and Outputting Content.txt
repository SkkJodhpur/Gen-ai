Once the generative model generates content, we need to transform it back into something the user can understand. This process is called decoding. The AI takes the encoded vectors and converts them into text, images, or other forms of output.

To the user, this whole process happens very quickly. This is because the generative model is created ahead of time, so the user only has to wait for:

Their input to be encoded
Content to be generated from an existing model
The output to be decoded and sent
