Welcome to the The Top ML Papers of the Week (July 8 - July 14):
1). FlashAttention-3 - proposes to adapt FlashAttention to take advantage of modern hardware; the techniques used to speed up attention on modern GPUs include producer-consumer asynchrony, interleaving block-wise matmul and softmax operations, and block quantization and incoherent processing; achieves speedup on H100 GPUs by 1.5-2.0x with FP16 reaching up to 740 TFLOPs/s (75% utilization), and with FP8 reaching close to 1.2 PFLOPs/s.

2). RankRAG - introduces a new instruction fine-tuning framework to perform effective context ranking and answering generation to enhance an LLMâ€™s RAG capabilities; it leverages a small ranking dataset to outperform existing expert ranking models; shows that a Llama3-RankRAG significantly outperforms Llama3-ChatQA-1.5 and GPT-4 models on nine knowledge-intensive benchmarks.

3). Mixture of A Million Experts - introduces a parameter-efficient expert retrieval mechanism that leverages the product key technique for sparse retrieval from a million tiny experts; it attempts to decouple computational cost from parameter count by efficiently routing to a very large number of tiny experts through a learned index structure used for routing; demonstrates superior efficiency compared to dense FFW, coarse-grained MoEs, and Product Key Memory (PKM) layers.

4). Reasoning in LLMs: A Geometric Perspective - explores the reasoning of LLMs from a geometrical perspective; reports that a higher intrinsic dimension implies greater expressive capacity of the LLM; reports that they establish a connection between the expressive power of LLMs and the density of their self-attention graphs; their analysis demonstrates that the density of these graphs defines the intrinsic dimension of the inputs to the MLP blocks.

5). Contextual Hallucinations Mitigation in LLMs - proposes a new method that detects and significantly reduces contextual hallucinations in LLMs (e.g., reduces by 10% in the XSum summarization task); builds a hallucination detection model based on input features given by the ratio of attention weights on the context vs. newly generated tokens (for each attention head); the hypothesis is that contextual hallucinations are related to the extent to which an LLM attends to the provided contextual information; they also propose a decoding strategy based on their detection method which mitigates the contextual hallucination; the detector can also be transferred across models without the need for retraining.
