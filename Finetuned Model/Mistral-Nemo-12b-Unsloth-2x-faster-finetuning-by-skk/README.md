# Mistral-Nemo-12b-Unsloth-2x-Faster-Finetuning
# Model Overview:
- **Developed by:** skkjodhpur
- **License:** Apache-2.0
- **Base Model:** unsloth/mistral-nemo-base-2407-bnb-4bit
- **Libraries Used:** Unsloth, Huggingface's TRL (Transformers Reinforcement Learning) library
- **Finetuned from model :** unsloth/mistral-nemo-base-2407-bnb-4bit

**Model Description**
The Mistral-Nemo-12b model has been fine-tuned for text generation tasks. This fine-tuning was performed using the Unsloth optimization framework, which significantly accelerates the training process, achieving a 2x faster fine-tuning time compared to conventional methods. The model leverages the robust capabilities of Huggingface's TRL library, enhancing its performance in generating high-quality text.

**Features**
**Language:** English
**Capabilities:** Text generation, transformers-based inference
**Fine-tuning Details:** The fine-tuning process was focused on improving inference speed and maintaining or enhancing the quality of the generated text.


This mistral model was trained 2x faster with [Unsloth](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth) and Huggingface's TRL library.
