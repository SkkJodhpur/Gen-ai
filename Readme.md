**🌟 GEN AI Repository 🌟**

Welcome to the GEN AI repository. This repository contains various projects and resources related to AI and Machine Learning, including fine-tuned models, implementations of LangChain, and other notable ML papers.

**📂 Repository Structure**

**🔧 Finetuned Model**
This folder contains fine-tuned models. These models have been pre-trained and then further refined for specific tasks to enhance their performance.

**🧠 Langchain**
Here, you'll find the LangChain Chat implementation with Mistral and Gemini models. LangChain is a framework designed to help developers create applications that generate natural language responses.

**📄 PAPERS**
This folder is regularly updated with the top ML papers of the week. It includes the latest research and developments in the field of AI and ML.

**🔍 RAG**
This section contains the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application using Langchain, OpenAI API, and FAISS. RAG combines retrieval and generation to provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

**🚀 Getting Started**
